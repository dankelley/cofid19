This website shows the reported incidence of the Covid-19 Novel coronavirus.
The data are acquired at midnight (Halifax/America time) from
https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series
and plotted with an [R
script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dankelley/cofid19/master/covid19.R).

The black symbols show the number of confirmed cases, summing across locations
to obtain a world-wide estimate.  Similarly, the green symbols indicate
recovered cases, and the red ones indicate deaths.  The top graph shows raw
counts, while the bottom one uses logarithmic scaling, where e.g. $10^4$ means
10 thousand cases.
